# Starts all 8 bounded-context HTTP services as background processes
# against Postgres + Kafka, in dependency order:
#   1. process-path-management — no deps (Generic Subdomain owning the
#                           fleet's declared process-path catalogue;
#                           publishes ProcessPathCreated/Updated/
#                           Deactivated to Kafka, which the other five
#                           services below optionally consume when they
#                           set PATH_CATALOGUE_SOURCE=kafka -- see
#                           warehouse-infra's deploy_process_path_kafka_source
#                           Terraform variable for the equivalent live-
#                           cluster toggle)
#   2. facility-layout   — no deps (Open Host Service for the warehouse map).
#                           Runs with EVENT_PUBLISHER=kafka so its Published
#                           Language actually reaches
#                           warehouse.facility.events — without that the
#                           topic is never created and inventory-storage's
#                           cache below has nothing to replay.
#   3. inventory-storage — maintains a LOCAL CACHE of facility-layout's
#                           location classifications, fed by that topic
#                           (LOCATION_LOOKUP_MODE=kafka, inventory-storage
#                           ADR-0013), instead of calling facility-layout
#                           over HTTP on every stow. FACILITY_LAYOUT_BASE_URL
#                           is still exported so a local run can be flipped
#                           back to LOCATION_LOOKUP_MODE=http (the rollback)
#                           by changing one word.
#   4. wes-work-planning — calls inventory-storage over HTTP for product
#                           classification (PRODUCT_CLASSIFICATION_MODE=http),
#                           consumes workforce/inventory/fulfillment/order-management Kafka topics
#   5. fulfillment-execution — consumes WorkReleased from wes-work-planning's
#                           Kafka topic, calls inventory-storage over HTTP for
#                           DOT hazard segregation, publishes TaskCompleted
#   6. labor-performance  — consumes fulfillment-execution's TaskCompleted
#                           (unconditional, no toggle) to compute
#                           engineered-labor-standards performance scoring;
#                           no HTTP calls to/from any other context.
#   7. workforce-management — publishes ShiftPlanCommitted to Kafka, which
#                           wes-work-planning's labor-plan-view projects
#   8. order-management  — calls inventory-storage over HTTP (synchronous
#                           allocation), then publishes OrderAllocated /
#                           OrderPartiallyAllocated to Kafka, which
#                           wes-work-planning's 4th consumer subscription
#                           turns into a work unit via EnqueueWorkUnit —
#                           the choreographed-release path this repo's new
#                           order_management_choreographed_release.feature
#                           proves end-to-end.
#
# All seven publisher-capable services run with EVENT_PUBLISHER=kafka
# against the shared broker (labor-performance is the exception -- it has
# no EVENT_PUBLISHER flag at all, being a pure consumer, though it still
# needs KAFKA_BROKERS to build its consumer group) so the cross-context
# event flow (WorkReleased -> Task, TaskCompleted -> WorkUnit completion /
# labor-performance scoring, ShiftPlanCommitted -> labor-plan-view,
# OrderAllocated/OrderPartiallyAllocated -> WorkUnit) is exercised for
# real, not just each service in isolation. process-path-management's own
# catalogue events are NOT consumed by any of the six below in this harness
# today (each still
# defaults to PATH_CATALOGUE_SOURCE=file, matching the live cluster's own
# default-off toggle) -- process-path-management is started here so its
# REST API and Kafka publisher are available to exercise directly, and so
# opting a service into PATH_CATALOGUE_SOURCE=kafka locally is a one-line
# addition to that service's start_service call below, not a new harness
# feature.
