# Kafka itself is NOT started by this script (see below) -- it is owned by
# the warehouse-infra kind cluster and exposed to the host at
# localhost:9092 via a Bitnami externalAccess NodePort (warehouse-infra
# PR #6). This fleet runs exactly ONE Kafka broker platform-wide; the
# docker-compose-based broker this script used to start
# (docker-compose.kafka.yml, container "warehouse-kafka") was retired
# when that consolidation landed, so KAFKA_COMPOSE_FILE/
# KAFKA_CONTAINER_NAME in env.sh are dead weight kept only so a future
# cleanup PR can remove them from every script at once rather than
# leaving a partial migration.
