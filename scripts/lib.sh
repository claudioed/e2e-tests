  # NOTE on the pidfile-capture quirk: the original form of this function
  # wrapped the backgrounded command in `(cd workdir && env ... bin & echo
  # $! >pidfile)` — backgrounding a `&&`-list forces bash to fork an
  # *extra* subshell to host that list, and on macOS's bundled bash 3.2
  # (no job-control/monitor mode in a non-interactive script) `$!` taken
  # right after was observed to resolve to the CALLING script's own PID,
  # not the forked subshell's — so the pidfile recorded the wrong PID and
  # stop_service's `kill "${pid}"` either hit an unrelated process or
  # silently no-opped (kill -0 on the caller's own live PID always
  # succeeds, masking the bug). Verified via a standalone repro before
  # this fix: the recorded PID matched the top-level script, not the
  # child. Fixed by making `cd` happen INSIDE the single backgrounded
  # subshell (no nested `&&` list) and `exec`-ing the target binary so
  # the subshell's process image is replaced in place — one fork, one
  # PID, captured immediately via $! with nothing else run in between.
