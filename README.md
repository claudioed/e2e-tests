# warehouse-e2e (`e2e-tests`)

Black-box, over-the-wire end-to-end / system test harness for the
[warehouse-systems](https://github.com/claudioed) estate: builds and runs
every bounded context's real HTTP service (and MCP server) as independent
OS processes against real Postgres + Kafka, then drives them purely over
their published REST APIs with a [godog](https://github.com/cucumber/godog)
(Cucumber for Go) suite. It never imports another repo's Go packages —
exactly like a human running curl against a live deployment.

This repo is a study-project companion to six bounded-context repos
(`facility-layout`, `inventory-storage`, `wes-work-planning`,
`fulfillment-execution`, `workforce-management`, `order-management`) plus
the read-side decision-support agent `warehouse-ops-agent`, all siblings
under the same `warehouse-systems/` workspace root — see `env.sh`'s
`REPOS_ROOT` for the layout this harness assumes.

## What's covered

- **`features/bootstrap.feature`** — a single work unit flowing through
  every bounded context: facility-layout's physical map, inventory-storage
  stock, workforce-management's committed shift plan (Kafka →
  wes-work-planning's labor-plan-view), wes-work-planning's release (Kafka →
  fulfillment-execution's task creation), and fulfillment-execution's task
  completion (Kafka → wes-work-planning's completion read model).
- **`features/flow_balance_exception.feature`** (T5) — proves
  `warehouse-ops-agent`, the agentic read-side decision-support layer, end
  -to-end against the real MCP servers of all five contexts: three
  independent signals (a saturated wes-work-planning pool, a
  workforce-management staffing gap, a stuck fulfillment-execution task) are
  seeded for the same process path, and the agent must correlate them into
  the expected `FlowBalanceException` (E1) — a ranked recommendation with a
  full evidence trail — and surface the same exception in its daily brief
  (E3).
- **`features/order_management_choreographed_release.feature`** — proves
  order-management's choreographed-release redesign end-to-end: placing an
  order (`POST /orders`) with `allowPartialShipment=false` and lines that
  can be immediately allocated triggers, in the SAME call, synchronous
  allocation against inventory-storage (unchanged HTTP) followed by
  publishing `OrderAllocated`/`OrderPartiallyAllocated` to Kafka topic
  `warehouse.order-management.events` — which wes-work-planning's 4th
  consumer subscription (`handleOrderManagementEvent`) picks up and turns
  into a real work unit via its existing `EnqueueWorkUnit` use case, using
  the deterministic id `{order_id}-line-{line_no}`. This is order-
  management's only public REST surface in v1 (`POST /orders`,
  `GET /orders/{id}`, `POST /orders/{id}/retry-allocation`,
  `DELETE /orders/{id}`, `GET /healthz`) — there is no `/allocate` or
  `/release` endpoint anymore; release happens implicitly, choreographed
  over Kafka.

## Running locally

Prerequisites: Docker (for Postgres + the shared Kafka broker), Go
(matching `go.mod`), and all seven sibling repos checked out alongside this
one under the same parent directory.

```bash
cd e2e-tests
bash scripts/02-up-infra.sh      # Postgres (this repo) + shared Kafka
bash scripts/02b-migrate-wes.sh  # wes-work-planning has no self-migrate step
bash scripts/01-build.sh         # builds all 12 binaries (6 HTTP + 5 MCP + ops-agent)
bash scripts/03-up-services.sh   # starts all 12 as background processes
bash scripts/04-run-tests.sh     # runs the default godog suite (excludes @soak)
bash scripts/06-run-soak.sh      # OPTIONAL: the long-running @soak backlog-ramp run (see below)
bash scripts/05-down-services.sh # stops only what this harness started
```

`env.sh` is the single source of truth for every port, DB URL, and MCP
bearer key `scripts/*.sh` uses — edit ports there only.

## Sustained backlog-ramp soak (`features/soak_backlog_ramp.feature`, `@soak`)

`scripts/06-run-soak.sh` runs a dedicated, long-running scenario — by
default one hour — that ramps injected backlog into BOTH the `pick-soak`
and `pack-soak` process paths while a configurable pool of picker and
packer stations continuously claims and completes the resulting
fulfillment-execution tasks. It proves the estate stays up and keeps
processing under sustained, ramping load — unlike every other scenario
here, which proves a single deterministic unit of work flows correctly.

- **Excluded by default.** `e2e_test.go`'s `TestMain` filters scenarios
  with `GODOG_TAGS` (default `~@soak`, i.e. "everything except `@soak`"),
  so `scripts/04-run-tests.sh` and a plain `go test ./...` never run it.
  Only `scripts/06-run-soak.sh` sets `GODOG_TAGS=@soak` to run it in
  isolation.
- **Observational, not assertive.** Once picker/packer throughput can't
  keep up with the ramp, `wes-work-planning`'s `/release` legitimately
  returns `409` (WIP limit reached / pool empty) and
  `fulfillment-execution`'s `/claim-next` legitimately returns `409` (no
  claimable task) — both are counted in the printed summary, not treated
  as failures. The scenario only fails on a hard connectivity/setup
  problem (it never managed to enqueue a single work unit for the whole
  run).
- **Tunable via env vars** (all optional — see `soak_test.go` for exact
  defaults): `SOAK_DURATION` (default `1h`), `SOAK_RAMP_START_INTERVAL`
  (default `2s`), `SOAK_RAMP_END_INTERVAL` (default `200ms`),
  `SOAK_WIP_LIMIT` (default `20`, both paths), `SOAK_PICKERS` (default
  `3`), `SOAK_PACKERS` (default `2`).
- A quick smoke run before committing to the full hour:
  `SOAK_DURATION=1m SOAK_RAMP_START_INTERVAL=1s SOAK_RAMP_END_INTERVAL=200ms bash scripts/06-run-soak.sh`.

## Service lifecycle notes

- `scripts/lib.sh`'s `start_service_in`/`start_service` launch each binary
  in the background and record its PID to `run/pids/<name>.pid`;
  `stop_service` (`scripts/05-down-services.sh`) kills strictly by that
  PID file — never a blind `pkill` — so re-running the harness never
  touches an unrelated process on your machine.
- Known pitfall (fixed): backgrounding a `cd ... && ...` list forces an
  extra subshell fork, and on some bash builds `$!` taken right after
  resolves to the *caller's* PID rather than the child's, so the recorded
  PID could be wrong. `start_service_in` now backgrounds a single `( cd
  ... && exec ... )` subshell with no nested `&&` list, so `$!` is always
  the actual binary's PID.
- `fulfillment-execution`'s `main()` hardcodes a relative `migrations`
  path, so it (and its MCP server) are the only two services launched via
  `start_service_in` with their CWD set to that repo's root; every other
  service reads `MIGRATIONS_PATH` from the environment and runs fine from
  this harness's own CWD.
- `order-management` self-migrates on startup (same as facility-layout,
  inventory-storage, fulfillment-execution, and workforce-management) via
  `postgres.RunMigrations` inside its own `main()` — no separate migrate
  script is needed for it, unlike wes-work-planning (`02b-migrate-wes.sh`).

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `gofmt`, `go build`/`go vet`, a shell
syntax check on every `scripts/*.sh`, and `docker compose config`
validation. The full godog suite is NOT run in CI: it is a genuinely
multi-repo black-box harness (it builds and runs binaries from six
sibling repos plus `warehouse-ops-agent`, none of which are checked out in
a single-repo GitHub Actions run) — it is run and verified locally as part
of every change that touches it, the same pattern `e2s-tests`' equivalent
harness follows.
